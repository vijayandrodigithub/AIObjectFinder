**Powered by TensorFlow Lite Android App**
  This project uses a pre-trained model (**efficientdet_lite0.tflite**) from the TensorFlow Lite Model Zoo for efficient on-device inference.

**Use Cases:**
Smart Waste Management: Detect trash or recycle bins in public areas.
Assisted Navigation: Help visually impaired users recognize key objects like toilets or chairs.
IoT Integration: Could be extended to trigger smart devices when certain objects are detected.
Educational Tool: A learning resource for computer vision and Android ML integration.

**Features**
Real-time camera preview with CameraX.
Object detection using TensorFlow Lite.

**Identifies specific targets:**
Trash bin
Recycle bin
Chair
Water can
Toilet

**Displays Results View:**
Detection status (Found / Not Found)
Object label, confidence score, and category.
Button disables while detection is in progress.
Default message in blue before first capture.
